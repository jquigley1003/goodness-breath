Light Up the Grid with Goodness

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Three Steps

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Breathe in and imagine filling ourselves up 
by drawing from the well of our own inherent goodness.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Take a moment to consciously experience 
the beneficent power of this goodness.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Breathe out, intentionally channeling this goodness 
into our country and our world as a force of light.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Breathe In

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Take a Moment

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Breathe Out

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One person becomes 50 - becomes 100 - becomes 1,000
becomes 5,000 - becomes 50,000

11
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And we breathe together goodness.
