        <h1>The Goodness Breath Project</h1>
        <h3>Light Up the Grid with Goodness</h3>
        <p>The Goodness Breath is an ongoing spiritual practice for all of us
          to participate in at this time of upheaval andtransformation. It is a way
          of staying in powerful alignment with who we really are as human beings
          and what we are made of - <span
            style="font-style: italic;">goodness</span>.
        </p>
        <p>In these challenging times of witnessing our government enact war on our
          environment (wildlife, air and water, earth, national parks), on immigrants
          (e.g., separating parents from children), on our human rights and the very
          values that our democracy was founded on, it is so easy to “go low” — to
          match the ugliness with our own rage, disgust, fear and hatred.</p>
        <p>However, in order to turn things around, we are called to do the very
          opposite.  We need to take the high road, as in Michelle Obama’s
          declaration, “When they go low, we go high.”  And since virtually every day
          there is another assault on our democratic values, we must <span
            style="font-style: italic;">consistently</span> practice going “high.”</p>

        <h2>Let's explore the depths of each step:</h2>
        <p>
          1. Breathe in and fill up with the goodness that dwells at the core of our being. In
          order to do this, we must remember that goodness lives within us. A lot of people
          don’t have faith in their own goodness and often feel “not good enough” or “unworthy”
          in some way. These negative stories about ourselves must be seen for what they are —
          conditioning and narratives we have made up to explain negative experiences in our
          lives, usually in our younger years. The call is to relinquish any doubt about the
          fact of our own inherent goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Intentionally drink of this goodness and pause long enough to ideally feel the
          richness of goodness in your body. But whether we feel it or not, the goodness is
          there. There are various approaches to being aware of the goodness: Breathe into your
          heart. Acknowledge your essence. Pause and experience your essence as goodness. Some
          people describe this process as reaching deep inside of themselves, beyond their
          stories and personalities, into the spiritual well of our oneness. Others tell me
          that they intentionally tune into a sense of divinity or light within themselves that
          they believe is in all of us. Still others focus on the giving and receiving of
          kindness as a way to viscerally fill themselves up with goodness. Of course, feel
          free to experiment with various ways of tuning into goodness, and discover whatever
          works best for you. Bottom line, what is most important is that you find your way to
          access the goodness within you and you pause long enough to savor, in some manner,
          this essential goodness. Even one conscious moment can be transformative.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Intentionally channel this goodness out to others, into our country and our world
          as a force of light. With your exhalation, you propel this goodness from your heart
          and center, out into the world. You can use sound and body movement if this feels
          empowering for you. Or you can just use the power of visualization and intention to
          propel this Goodness out into the world as a force for global healing.

        <p>
          “I am one person remembering... and now I am two and now ten and now twenty and now
          the twenty becomes twenty million as we light up our Earth’s grid with goodness as a
          global prayer-in-action”
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what it is going to take — all over the world. We wake up to the force of our
          goodness and join together in a global movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine millions of humans, all across the world, participating in this focused
          spiritual practice — people of all races and languages, rich and poor, young and old
          — all breathing in goodness, breathing out goodness as a fierce force for
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how does one person become millions of people committed to Lighting Up the Grid
          with Goodness?
